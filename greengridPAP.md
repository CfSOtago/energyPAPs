# Geographical area
Regions of Taranaki and Hawke's Bay (New Zealand)

# Date of data colletion
April 2014 - June 2018

# Unit of study
Households

# Research questions/purpose (brief)
To understand electricity power demand at circuit level in a sample of New Zealand houses.

# Research methodology
Convenience/snowball sample
 
## Sample recruitment
Volunteers were sought via two collaborating electricity distribution businesses.

# Research methods
 * 10 second power data collected at circuit and overall household level
 * 'energy cultures' survey on household energy attitudes & habits
 * dwelling appliance audit
 
## Sample size and justification
Convenience sample of ~40 volunteer households. Sample size limited by available equipment budget.

## Allocation to study groups (if any)
Not applicable

# Proposed data cleaning

Data scanned for extreme outliers that show implausible kW values and these were removed from analysis. 

-ve, 0 or exceedingly small daily sum values will be used to test for correct monitoring installation. If not corrected by follow-up the household's data will be excluded from analysis. This is complicated by the presence of solar PV on some circuits.

# Proposed analytic methods

Descriptive and other analysis of patterns of demand.

Development of power demand models for heating and hot water.
